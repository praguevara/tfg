\chapter{Introduction}

Obesity represents a pressing global public health concern, affecting a
significant segment of the population. In a previous initiative, Tech4Diet
developed a system enabling patients undergoing weight loss treatment to
visualize 3D scans of their bodies throughout their weight loss
journey~\cite{Azorin-Lopez2020}. This innovative approach aimed to boost
motivation and increase treatment plan adherence.

Subsequently, we wondered if it would be feasible to utilize the datasets
acquired in this prior study to formulate a predictive model. This model would
project anticipated changes in a person's body undergoing weight loss treatment
before the treatment concludes, further bolstering adherence to the treatment
regimen. The present work explores the development of such a model. This
includes analyzing data from the earlier study, reviewing existing techniques
in human body model representation, encoding patient data using the chosen
representation, devising a neural network architecture for predicting patient
body changes, and finally, training and evaluating the model.
